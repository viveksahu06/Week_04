/*4. Serialization - Save and Retrieve an Object
 Problem Statement:
Design a Java program that allows a user to store a list of employees in a file using Object Serialization and
later retrieve the data from the file.
Requirements:
Create an Employee class with fields: id, name, department, salary.
Serialize the list of employees into a file (ObjectOutputStream).
Deserialize and display the employees from the file (ObjectInputStream).
Handle ClassNotFoundException and IOException.
