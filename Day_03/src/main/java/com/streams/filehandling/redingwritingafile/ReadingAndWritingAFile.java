//File Handling - Read and Write a Text File
//📌 Problem Statement:
//Write a Java program that reads the contents of a text file and writes it into a new file.
// If the source file does not exist, display an appropriate message.
//Requirements:
//Use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
//Handle IOException properly.
//Ensure that the destination file is created if it does not exist.
