//Buffered Streams - Efficient File Copy
//ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
//Create a Java program that copies a large file (e.g., 100MB) from one location to another
// using Buffered Streams (BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream).
// Compare the performance with normal file streams.
//        Requirements:
//Read and write in chunks of 4 KB (4096 bytes).
//Use System.nanoTime() to measure execution time.
//Compare execution time with unbuffered streams.
