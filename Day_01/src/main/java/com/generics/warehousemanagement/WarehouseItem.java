/*1. Smart Warehouse Management System
Concepts: Generic Classes, Bounded Type Parameters, Wildcards
Problem Statement:
You are developing a Smart Warehouse System that manages different types of items like Electronics, Groceries, and Furniture. The system should be able to store and retrieve items dynamically while maintaining type safety.
Hints:
Create an abstract class WarehouseItem that all items extend (Electronics, Groceries, Furniture).
Implement a generic class Storage<T extends WarehouseItem> to store items safely.
Implement a wildcard method to display all items in storage regardless of their type (List<? extends WarehouseItem>).

package com.generics.warehousemanagement;

// Abstract class representing a generic warehouse item
abstract class WarehouseItem {
    private String name;

    public WarehouseItem(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Each item type must provide its own implementation for displaying details
    public abstract void displayInfo();
}
